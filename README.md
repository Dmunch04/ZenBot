# Goals
Our goal is to create a multifuncional bot, which has a per server settings feature. This would allow each server, to customize ZenBot to their likings. Our aim for that customizing, is to create a website with a web panel, but for now we'll just be having a command for that. Some of the settings things you could change is:
- Each command enabled
- Profanity filter
- Profanity filter words
- Warns to kick/ban
- XP per message and if this should be enabled
- Staff command roles
- And more

We'll also be having a lot of commands:
- Help
- About
- Rules
- Server

- Role [Role]
